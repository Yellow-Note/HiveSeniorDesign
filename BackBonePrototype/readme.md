# Back End Backbone Prototype
## James Lucid

<p>How to compile: g++ -o test main.cpp -std=c++11 -pthread</p>

<p> What this does </p>
This is a work in progress backbone for the back end. It doesn't do anything other than make and play with a large set of random numbers at this time.<br>
My intention here is to make it easy to implement everything once it's all in place.<br><br>

<p> How to use this </p>
test number <br>
with number being the number of frames it's going to process. <br><br>

<p> Current state of progress: <br>
Successfully divides work into queues for threads to work on.<br>
Going to emulate rxD and Analysis next.
