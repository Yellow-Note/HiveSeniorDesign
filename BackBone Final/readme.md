<p> What this does </p>
Takes a folder of frames and creates a seperate folder and moves all the original images to the new folder along with performing RXD on them <br>
<br>

<p> How to use this </p>
**Command:** RXD.exe [threshold] [video name] <br>
Recomended threshold is 30 <br>
<br>

<p>Notes for successful testing:<br>
The folder with all the images must follow the following naming convention<br>
<br>
[video name][extention]-slicer-out
<br>

<p>Current completion<br>
Only returns the black and white heat map. Still needs more work to differenciant between anomolies and anomolous images.
